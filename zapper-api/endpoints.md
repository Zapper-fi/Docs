# Endpoints

## Public API Key

The Zapper API uses [API Keys](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/) to authenticate requests. Zapper has made available for public use the following API key **`api_key=96e0cc51-a62e-42ca-acee-910ea7d2a241`**

{% hint style="info" %}
We ask that builders using the API include our **"Powered by Zapper"** logo with a backlink to [https://zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi) in their project. **"Powered by Zapper"**  brand asset can be downloaded [here](../additional-resources/brand-assets.md).
