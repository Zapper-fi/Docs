# Endpoints

## Public API Key

The Zapper API uses [API Keys](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/) to authenticate requests. Zapper has made available for public use the following API key **`api_key=96e0cc51-a62e-42ca-acee-910ea7d2a241`**

The API key must be provided as a query string by the client when making API calls. If your project consumes the Zapper API, a mention that your app is **"Powered by Zapper"** with a backlink to [https://zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi) would be appreciated. We have a powered by zapper brand asset that can be use and can be found [here](../additional-resources/brand-assets.md).

## Zapper Endpoints

The Swagger UI ****linked below contains an overview of all of the available endpoints. Be creative and feel free to reach out to us with suggestions or to show us what you've built.

If you enter in the **public API key into the Authorize section in Swagger** you will be able to directly test the endpoints in the Swagger UI.
