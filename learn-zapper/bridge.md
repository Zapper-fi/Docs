## What is the Purpose of a Bridge?

A bridge is an easy way of porting assets from Ethereum to layer 2s and sidechains. By being able to port their assets over, you gain access to lower fees when interacting with different defi protocols. Zapper currently only supports a one way bridge, but there are plans to make it a two way bridge in the near future.
