### A constant mean market maker is a generalization of a constant product market maker, allowing for more than two assets and weights outside of 50/50.

 _where **R** is the **reserves** of each asset, **W** is the **weights** of each asset, and **k** is the **constant**. In other words, in the absence of fees, constant mean markets ensure that the **weighted geometric mean** of the reserves remains constant._

| **Balancer Protocol** | system of smart contracts for automated token exchange on Ethereum. |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Balancer Exchange** | opensource front-end interface for traders and liquidity providers to easily interact with Balancer smart contracts. |
| **Balancer Pool** | Exchange contract containing ERC20 pairs. |
| **Liquidity Providers**  | can be anyone who is able to supply equal values of WETH or any ERC-20 token included in a Balancer exchange contract. |
| **BPool** | ERC20 tokens which are minted by LPs from the exchange contract and can be used to withdraw their proportion of the liquidity at any time. |
| **Traders** | exchange one asset for another asset. |
| **Arbitrageurs** | maintain the price of assets within that portfolio in accordance with the market price in exchange for a profit. |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: slippage will increase with larger deposits because your input is being proportionally exchanged to obtain underlying assets required to join the pool with. In order to prevent unnecessary losses due to this price impact, _**currently the slippage limit is set to 5%. This means that if your exchange transaction experiences greater than 5% difference between the market and estimated price due to trade size, the transaction will revert.**_
