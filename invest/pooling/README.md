## What does "Pooling" mean

> **Providing liquidity to** [_**constant function market makers**_](https://medium.com/bollinger-investment-group/constant-function-market-makers-defis-zero-to-one-innovation-968f77022159) _**& earning proportional exchange fees in return.**_ 
>
> ### Traditional Finance: 
>
> * Most exchanges _**maintain an order book**_ and facilitate matches between buyers and sellers. 
> * For each successful match, traders are charged _**exchange fees**_ which go directly to exchange operators. 
>
> ### The DeFi Difference:
>
> * _**Smart contracts hold liquidity**_ reserves of various tokens, and trades are executed directly against these reserves. 
> * _**Prices are set automatically**_ using the constant product market maker mechanism, which keeps overall reserves in relative equilibrium. 
> * Reserves are pooled between a network of liquidity providers who supply the system with tokens and receive a _**proportional share of transaction fees**_ accrued. 
> * **IMPORTANT NOTE:** With fluctuating prices, liquidity providers may incur [**“impermanent loss”**](https://medium.com/@pintail/understanding-uniswap-returns-cc593f3499ef)**.**
